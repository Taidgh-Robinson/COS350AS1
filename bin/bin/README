Included in this is my solution to homework 1. 

It includes:

The JJ method, which is the main algorithm to the problem. 
The tester method, which was used to test the run times, for different values of n and len(D).
The main method, which handles UI calls to the JJ method. 

Runtime calculation from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/180158/how-do-i-time-a-methods-execution-in-java. 

It also includes the files 1,2,3,4 which were used to graph the run times of those respective tests (the filename being the len(D) and each value before the colon being n). 
Due to hardware limits and a SUPER inefficent algorithm certain len(D) were only able to be calculated to roughly n=25.

The graphs were included in the printed version of the hw.
